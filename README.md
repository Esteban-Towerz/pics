- V1. We are going to to a search or a request to an outside API(https://unsplash.com/) that is going to find images that match whatever term that user just entered.

- V2. How we show these images to the user using Grid CSS like a tile the images across the screen, as images tend to not be identical sizes, so i want to figure out some really clever ways in which we can make sure to tile them to all line up very nicely.

- [x] How do we fetch data from outside API or Server
- [x] How do we show lists of records?
